#  Rabbit Tortoise 

1. **Detecting Cycles in a Linked List (Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm)**
   - The rabbit (fast pointer) moves two steps at a time, and the tortoise (slow pointer) moves one step at a time.

   - If there’s a cycle in the list, the two pointers will eventually meet. If the rabbit reaches the end of the list, there’s no cycle.

2. **Finding the Middle of a Linked List:**
   - The tortoise pointer moves one step at a time, while the rabbit pointer moves two steps.

   - By the time the rabbit reaches the end of the list, the tortoise will be at the middle of the list.
